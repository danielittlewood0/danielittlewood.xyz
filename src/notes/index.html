        I often have problems configuring my system, and if the problem is not
        easily solved then I tend to write notes to myself about how to fix it.
        If I put them here, then (selfishly) I can access them easily in
        multiple places, and (selflessly) other people in similar situations
        might benefit from reading the things I tried.
      </p>

      <p>
        I usually write the notes themselves in 
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown">Markdown</a>,
        and then post-process them into HTML.
