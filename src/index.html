          Welcome to my site - I am a <a href="https://www.gentoo.org/">Gentoo
          Linux</a> enthusiast, and a patron of the <a
          href="https://www.fsf.org/">Free Software Foundation</a>, so expect
          to find content of that nature.

          <h2> Notes </h2>
          <p>
            I often have problems configuring my system, and if the problem is not
            easily solved then I tend to write notes to myself about how to fix it.
            If I put them here, then (selfishly) I can access them easily in
            multiple places, and (selflessly) other people in similar situations
            might benefit from reading the things I tried.
          </p>

          <p>
            I usually write the notes themselves in 
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown">Markdown</a>,
            and then post-process them into HTML using
            <a href="https://pandoc.org/">pandoc</a>.

            <p>
              Setting up a website is much harder than I expected, so I compiled
              some pointers together in case someone else wants to copy what
              I've done.

            <p>
              When I switched to Gentoo, my laptop was warmer than I expected
              during normal use. It turned out that my CPU was running at max
              frequency all the time, which was making it consume more power
              (and hence warm up).

          <h2> Free Software </h2>
          <p> 
            This covers anything to do with Free software which I either think
            is worth publicising, that I use personally and patch, or that I have
            written and maintain myself. 

            I also plan to keep my <emph>dotfiles</emph> (configuration files
            for various packages) indexed here.

            <p>
              st is a simple terminal emulator for X which 
              <a href="https://st.suckless.org/">sucks less</a>. 
              It is configured by patching the source code, which is written in
              C. To see the changes I've made, plus an explanation of how they
              work, take a look at 
              <a href="https://github.com/danielittlewood0/st">my fork</a> on Github.
