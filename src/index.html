        <p>
          Welcome to my site - I am a <a href="https://www.gentoo.org/">Gentoo
          Linux</a> enthusiast, and a patron of the <a
          href="https://www.fsf.org/">Free Software Foundation</a>, so expect
          to find content of that nature.

          <h2> Notes </h2>
          <p>
            I often have problems configuring my system, and if the problem is not
            easily solved then I tend to write notes to myself about how to fix it.
            If I put them here, then (selfishly) I can access them easily in
            multiple places, and (selflessly) other people in similar situations
            might benefit from reading the things I tried.
          </p>

          <p>
            I usually write the notes themselves in 
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown">Markdown</a>,
            and then post-process them into HTML using
            <a href="https://pandoc.org/">pandoc</a>.

            <p>
              Setting up a website is much harder than I expected, so I compiled
              some pointers together in case someone else wants to copy what
              I've done.

            <p>
              In a modern desktop environment, there are usually designated
              tools to manage things like the keyboard. This post explains how
              to do it by hand, on a system running X.

          <h2> Free Software </h2>
          <p> 
            This covers anything to do with Free software which I either think
            is worth publicising, that I use personally and patch, or that I have
            written and maintain myself. 

            I also plan to keep my <emph>dotfiles</emph> (configuration files
            for various packages) indexed here.

              tmux is a popular terminal multiplexer.
