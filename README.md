This is the source code for [https://www.danielittlewood.xyz](my personal
site), it is intended first and foremost to be *simple*. So, at least at the
time of writing, it is intended only for serving static content - no
frameworks, no javascript.

Of course, even for a static site there will be bits of content which are
pre-processed. I expect to write a program for building these materials into
HTML, but have not done so yet.

A major advantage of keeping the site simple is *accessibility*, which I think
is a core concept of web design. I will add more detail about what steps I've
taken to make the site accessible later.
